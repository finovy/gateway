This project has been expanded on the basis of Spring Cloud Gateway to build a high-performance gateway. It not only provides functions such as proxy, routing, load balancing, health checks, and authentication, but also serves as an entry layer for system traffic. At the same time, we have also implemented the function of customizing routing files in the configuration center, thereby achieving dynamic refreshing of routes.
