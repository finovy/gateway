#  Getting Started

1. **Configure Application Files**: Start by configuring application files in the configuration center, such as `gateway.yaml`. These files allow you to manage dynamic parameters post-service startup.
2. **Customize Your Routes**: Tailor your routing experience by configuring the `gateway-routes.json` file in the configuration center. Dive into the Configuration Reference for detailed guidance.
3. **Seamless Integration**: Clone our repository and smoothly integrate your configuration center details into `gateway-bootstrap/src/main/resources/environment/application.yaml`. Alternatively, configure these details within your project's environment variables.
4. **Launch and Thrive**: Fire up your `tech.finovy.gateway.GatewayBackendApplication` and embark on your high-performance journey.
